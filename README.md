## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce sales and customer data to uncover various trends and insights. Using SQL for querying and Python for visualization, the project aims to explore a range of queries from basic to advanced, providing a detailed understanding of sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue distribution. The analysis utilizes libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy for visualizing results and deriving actionable insights.

## Key Features

### Basic Queries
1. **Unique Cities**: Identify all unique cities where customers are located.
2. **Orders Count (2017)**: Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
3. **Total Sales per Category**: Calculate total sales for each product category.
4. **Installment Payments Percentage**: Determine the percentage of orders paid in installments.
5. **Customer Count by State**: Count the number of customers from each state.

### Intermediate Queries
1. **Orders per Month (2018)**: Calculate the number of orders per month for the year 2018.
2. **Average Products per Order**: Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
3. **Revenue by Product Category**: Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
4. **Price and Purchase Correlation**: Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
5. **Revenue by Seller**: Calculate and rank total revenue generated by each seller.

### Advanced Queries
1. **Moving Average of Order Values**: Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
2. **Cumulative Sales per Month**: Calculate cumulative sales per month for each year.
3. **Year-over-Year Sales Growth**: Determine the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
4. **Customer Retention Rate**: Calculate the retention rate of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
